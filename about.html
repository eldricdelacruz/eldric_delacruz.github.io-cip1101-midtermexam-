				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img src="aboutpic.jpg" alt="Me traveling">
				<p>Hi, my name is Anita Pea and I am the author of this travel blog. I have always had a passion for exploring new places and learning about different cultures. After finishing college, I decided to take a gap year and travel the world. This experience changed my life and inspired me to share my adventures through this blog.</p>
				<p>Throughout my travels, I have had many unforgettable experiences and made countless memories. Some of my favorite moments include hiking Machu Picchu, swimming with dolphins in Hawaii, and trying new foods in Italy. I believe that travel is not only about seeing new places, but also about discovering more about oneself and the world.</p>
				<p>Here are some of my personal photos and anecdotes related to travel:</p>
